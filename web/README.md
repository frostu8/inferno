# `inferno` JavaScript enhancements
`inferno` is designed to operate in a no-JavaScript environment. However, it
turns out the internet is not bleak (yet) and many, many user agents will still
serve and run JavaScript.

This module contains some npm packages and glue that the app can use in
Effects to access them.
